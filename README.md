* ✈️ Airlines Flight Data Analysis Using Python & MySQL

Welcome to the Airlines Flight Data Analysis project!
This project explores over 300,000+ flight records from Indian airlines to uncover insights into pricing trends, routes, demand, and airline performance using Python and SQL.

📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize large-scale flight data to identify patterns in ticket pricing, route popularity, and travel demand.
By leveraging Python and SQL, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights into how various factors such as airline type, travel class, stops, source/destination city, duration, and days left before departure affect flight pricing and performance.

* 🧠 Objectives

* Uncover pricing trends across airlines, classes, and routes.
* Determine the busiest routes and airports.
* Compare average fares based on stops, duration, and departure timing.
* Use SQL queries and Python visualizations to derive key business insights.

* 🧰 Technologies Used

Programming & Libraries:
 1. Python, Pandas, NumPy
 2. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
 3. pandasql, MySQL
 4. Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
 
* 📊 Visualizations
 1. Price Distribution Across Airlines
 2. Average Price: Economy vs. Business Class
 3. Busiest Source & Destination Cities
 4. Days Left vs. Ticket Price Trend
 5. Stops vs. Price Comparison
 6. Duration Impact on Ticket Pricing

* 🧾 SQL Queries Implemented

Example queries include:
  1. Average ticket price per airline
  2. Top 5 most expensive routes
  3. Cheapest airline for Business class
  4. Busiest routes and flight counts
  5. Price variation by stops and duration
  6. Time-of-day pricing trends
